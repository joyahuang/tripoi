## Goal

> As a former urban planner, I like look up things in a map. But:
>
> - Tons of top places to visit articles, but they don't provide coordinate.
> - Have a place name and have to find more detailed from other websites.
>
> I solved it with tripoi.

- Interactive map: display places of interest for travellers, zoom and move the map to set the boundaries of data.
- Filters: type of place (restaurant, hotel, attraction), rating.
- Search: user can locate into any places.
- Weather: current weather on the nearest weather station.
